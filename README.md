# Liver Patient Prediction

## Overview

The Liver Patient Prediction project aims to predict whether a patient has liver disease based on various clinical attributes. This project utilizes a dataset containing medical records and applies machine learning techniques to classify patients as either having liver disease or not.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is included in the repository as a CSV file. It consists of multiple attributes related to liver health, such as:

- Age
- Gender
- Total Bilirubin
- Direct Bilirubin
- Alkaline Phosphatase
- Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT)
- Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST)
- Total Proteins
- Albumin
- Albumin and Globulin Ratio
- Target Variable (1 for liver disease, 0 for no disease)

## Installation

To run this project, follow these steps:

### Clone this repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Tejalkhadke/LiverPatientPrediction.git
cd LiverPatientPrediction
```

### Install the required dependencies:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the following command to train and evaluate the model:

```sh
python main.py
```

## Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing and analyzing dataset characteristics.
- **Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and feature scaling.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Applying various classification algorithms to predict liver disease.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to measure model performance.
